;;; Define my own keyboard bindings.

;;; Code:

;;; Bind helm-mini to Control-c m
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c m") 'helm-mini)

;;; Provide forward and backward-paragraph for Mac keyboards.
(global-set-key (kbd "M-]") 'forward-paragraph) ;mc key unreachable with German keyboard 
(global-set-key (kbd "M-[") 'backward-paragraph) ;mc key unreachable with German keyboard 
;mc german keyboard:
(global-set-key (kbd "M-+") 'forward-paragraph) 
(global-set-key (kbd "M-Ã¼") 'backward-paragraph)

;;; FIXME: Why does C-M-d not respond?
;mc (global-set-key (kbd "C-M-y") 'down-list)
;mc in my case already bound to much cooler functions (C-M-d and C-M-u) for traversing 'list' levels

;;; NOTE: See emacs-customization-general.el for turning off prelude mode in org-mode.
;;; This is necessary because of keyboard binding imcompatibilities between these two modes.

;;; keyboard-bindings.el ends here
